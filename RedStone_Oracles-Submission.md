# Problem

Canto builders have been restricted by the lack of Oracles & diversified data feeds for months.
But now RedStone comes with a unique value proposition:

‚öíÔ∏è Over 1100 data feeds, updated each 10 sec by a robust Oracle ‚öíÔ∏è

Explore long-tail, LP, staked, canto-native tokens; indexes; commodities; Forex; custom data feeds, i.e. NFT related.
All of them pulled from 50+ sources, browse them yourself: <https://app.redstone.finance/>
Best example? We integrated Canto token too! <https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/CANTO>

## How does it work?

We utilise signature verification & call-data costs efficiency üëå
1. In RedStone flow, Data Providers push signed data packages (with timestamps) to a proprietary Data Delivery Network (DDN).
DDN is built with Arweave, Streamr Network, RedStone nodes and other reliability services.
2. dApp on Canto integrates RedStone and fetches data off-chain only when it's needed. 
3. For example, Mr Anon wants to take a loan from Canto Lending. 
Mr Anon sends transaction, Canto Lending fetches the signed package off-chain from DDN, attaches it to Anon's transaction call-data.
Smart Contract receives transaction, extracts data from call-data, verifies signatures and executes the order.

## What if I prefer traditional Oracle model?

RedStone offer Canto builders three models:
- Costs optimised RedStone model: described above
- RedStone Oracle legacy model: we push data on Canto chain with a heartbeat and diviation update.
Traditional approach, the more frequent data updates & the more data feeds, the more expensive it gets.
- RedStoneX model: Tailor made model for each user, most expensive but most secure. 
a) User sends trasaction on Canto via a dApp in block N, i.e. short position creation.
b) Resolver (anyone running a script) connects price from DDN to transaction call-data.
c) dApp places & executes transaction in block N+1 with the price feed attached.

Tight cooperation with the ecosystem builders is crucial for us ü§ù
